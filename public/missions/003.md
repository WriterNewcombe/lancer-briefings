## Honest Trick

The Black Daggers are trying to run supplies to Sparri rebels on Century. They’re reaching out to their contacts to see who would be willing to escort their ship from the asteroid field and protect the delivery until it’s safely on the planet. Just Axiom cannot be seen working directly with pirates, but they do support the fight for Sparri autonomy.

# Goals
- Make sure the supplies reach the Sparri rebels on Century

# Stakes
- Failure could mean exposure for Just Axiom in addition to the Sparri not getting supplies they need to fight the Convocation occupation.
