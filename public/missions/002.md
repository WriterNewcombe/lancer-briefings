## Honest Trick

The Black Dagger are trying to run supplies to Sparri rebels on Century. They need an escort for their ship from the asteroid field to Century. Once landed, they'll need the team to protect the delivery until itâ€™s safely on the planet. 

# Goals
- Make sure the supplies reach the Sparri rebels on Century

# Stakes
- Failure could mean the Sparri not getting supplies they need to fight the Convocation occupation, collateral damage to The Black Dagger, or bad public exposure for the Just Axiom.
