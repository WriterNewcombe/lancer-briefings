# Mission // #001
## Serene Harvest
A refinery union on Cazeti is striking and blocking scab workers sent in from Century. This action is probably legal, but the Convocation have deemed it an act of sabotage. A unidentified ship was deployed to the refinery, and Just Axiom suspects it is a Convocation squad.

# Goals
- Protect the striking workers at the Husk Corp Refinery on Cazeti
- Determine the identity and aims of the attackers
- Secure evidence of their objectives
  - Especially if it incriminates the Convocation
