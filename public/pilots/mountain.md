For many years, she bounced from place to place, staying with various friends and sympathetic family members, surviving off odd jobs, and gradually becoming involved in the same sort of work - the tradition, she liked to think of it - that her parents had; worker organization, mutual aid, defense against the increasingly brutal crackdowns of the Convocation as their hold on the broader Or-Dyn Corporate Zone began to deteriorate. It was here, over many decades, that she acquired the skills and reputation of a leader and mech pilot. Working in construction and mining rigs, then retrofitting them to hold the line against Convocation-backed strikebreakers; jerry-rigging stolen corporate computing and comms equipment; convincing often scared and squabbling interests to work together long enough to present a unified threat; helping pull together networks of information, resources, people. Many of the groups she worked with would be crushed, or choked, or co-opted; but a few would survive, would join the conflagration that would become Just Axiom. 

Just Axiom's faith in Union is, in Kedra's opinion, misguided; she's too old to believe in pretty words from those who would parley with people she's watched commit fifty years of atrocities. But they do have, for the moment, a common enemy.
